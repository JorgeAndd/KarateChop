KarateChop (binary search)

Kata following http://codekata.com/kata/kata02-karate-chop/

Binary Search implementation using 5 different techniques

## Day #1
- Setting environment
- Understanding unit testing using C# and Visual Studio
- First Implementation:
  - Simple approach: indexes *start*, *end* and *middle* are calculated to walk on array

## Day #2
- Simple recursive implementation of binary search
- Easier then first day. Maybe because I am remembering C# and data structure algorithms;

## Day #3
- Kinda simple implementation, similar to the first one, but not using division. Uses only addition and subtraction and variables to keep track of array limits;
- Getting hard to think of different approaches;
